# Wool Wars Multi-Location Mode - Technical Documentation

## Overview
This document provides comprehensive technical documentation for the multi-location scoring feature added to Wool Wars v1.3. This feature allows teams to compete across 2-5 different locations with rotating scoring intervals.

## Core Concept
Instead of having a single control point, multi-location mode creates N control points that are scored in a fixed rotation every 10/N minutes (by default). This creates more dynamic gameplay where teams must manage multiple locations simultaneously.

## Architecture

### Data Structures

#### Multi-Location State Management
- `ww_multi_mode` - Flag indicating if multi-location mode is active (0=single, 1=multi)
- `ww_loc_count` - Number of active locations (2-5)
- `ww_loc_setup_count` - Tracks how many locations have been placed during setup
- `ww_current_loc_index` - Which location (0-4) is currently being scored

#### Location Coordinate Arrays
For each location index 0-4:
- `ww_loc_x_N` - X coordinate of location N
- `ww_loc_y_N` - Y coordinate of location N  
- `ww_loc_z_N` - Z coordinate of location N

#### Wool State Arrays
For each location index 0-4:
- `ww_current_wool_N` - Current wool type at location N (0=none, 1-16=colors)
- `ww_previous_wool_N` - Previous wool type at location N (for change detection)

### Timer System

#### Interval Calculation
- Default: 10 minutes ÷ N locations = (12000 ticks) ÷ N
- Example: 3 locations = 4000 ticks = 3.33 minutes between scoring events
- Configurable via `/function wool_wars:util/set_timer {minutes:M}`

#### Rotation Logic
1. Timer counts down from interval
2. When timer hits 0:
   - Score current location (`ww_current_loc_index`)
   - Advance to next location: `(current + 1) % location_count`
   - Reset timer to interval
   - Continue rotation

## Implementation Details

### Setup Process

1. **Command Execution**: `/function wool_wars:multi/setup {count:N}`
   - Validates N is between 2-5
   - Clears existing markers
   - Sets up scoreboards and variables
   - Calculates timer interval: 12000 ÷ N ticks
   - Gives player N bedrock blocks

2. **Bedrock Placement**:
   - Each bedrock placement increments `ww_loc_setup_count`
   - Coordinates stored in `ww_loc_x/y/z_[setup_count]`
   - Glowing marker entity created at each location
   - Setup completes when `ww_loc_setup_count` reaches `ww_loc_count`

3. **Game Start**:
   - Timer starts counting down from calculated interval
   - Location 0 is set as first target
   - All locations begin wool detection

### Wool Detection System

#### Per-Tick Processing
```mcfunction
# In tick.mcfunction
execute if score #multi ww_multi_mode matches 1 run function wool_wars:multi/check_all_locations
```

#### Location Checking Chain
```mcfunction
# check_all_locations.mcfunction
execute if score #multi ww_loc_count matches 2.. run function wool_wars:multi/util/check_wool_at_location_0
execute if score #multi ww_loc_count matches 2.. run function wool_wars:multi/util/check_wool_at_location_1
# ... etc for locations 2-4 based on ww_loc_count
```

#### Macro-Based Coordinate Resolution
```mcfunction
# check_wool_at_location_0.mcfunction
execute store result storage wool_wars:multi x int 1 run scoreboard players get #multi ww_loc_x_0
execute store result storage wool_wars:multi y int 1 run scoreboard players get #multi ww_loc_y_0
execute store result storage wool_wars:multi z int 1 run scoreboard players get #multi ww_loc_z_0
function wool_wars:multi/util/check_wool_at_position_0 with storage wool_wars:multi
```

### Scoring System

#### Location-Specific Scoring
- Only the current location (`ww_current_loc_index`) is scored when timer expires
- Scoring messages include location index: `"Red Team scores at Location #2!"`
- After scoring, advance to next location in rotation

#### Timer Display
Format: `"⏱ 2m 30s → Loc #3  100, 64, 200"`
- Shows countdown to next scoring event
- Indicates which location will be scored
- Displays coordinates of next target location

### Visual Feedback System

#### Persistent Glowing Markers
- Marker entities with `ww_location_marker` tag at each location
- `Glowing:1b` property makes them visible through blocks
- Team assignment changes marker glow color based on current wool
- Color mapping: wool color → team color → marker glow color

#### Marker Color Updates
```mcfunction
# update_marker_colors.mcfunction called every tick
execute if score #multi ww_current_wool_0 matches 1 run function wool_wars:multi/util/set_marker_team_0 {team:"ww_white"}
execute if score #multi ww_current_wool_0 matches 2 run function wool_wars:multi/util/set_marker_team_0 {team:"ww_orange"}
# ... etc for all 16 wool colors
```

### Backward Compatibility

#### Mode Detection
All core functions use conditional execution:
```mcfunction
# Single-location mode
execute if score #multi ww_multi_mode matches 0 run function wool_wars:check_wool_dynamic

# Multi-location mode  
execute if score #multi ww_multi_mode matches 1 run function wool_wars:multi/check_all_locations
```

#### Existing Commands
- All existing commands continue to work in single-location mode
- Timer commands work in both modes with appropriate messaging
- Team and scoring systems remain unchanged

## Command Reference

### Setup Commands
- `/function wool_wars:multi/setup {count:N}` - Enable multi-location mode (N=2-5)
- `/function wool_wars:multi/disable` - Return to single-location mode

### Management Commands  
- `/function wool_wars:multi/show_locations` - Display all locations and coordinates
- `/function wool_wars:util/set_timer {minutes:M}` - Set interval between location scoring

### Information Commands
- Existing `/function wool_wars:scoring/show_scores` works in both modes
- Existing timer controls (pause/unpause/reset) work in both modes

## Technical Considerations

### Performance
- Wool detection runs every tick for all active locations
- Marker color updates run every tick when wool changes
- Coordinate lookups use scoreboard operations (efficient)
- Macro functions used for dynamic coordinate handling

### Limitations
- Maximum 5 locations due to scoreboard array size
- Marker entities persist until manually cleared
- Setup requires placing all N locations before game starts

### Error Handling
- Setup validates location count (2-5)
- Bedrock placement stops after N locations placed
- Returns gracefully if commands run in wrong mode

## Future Enhancement Opportunities

### Potential Improvements
1. **Dynamic Location Management**: Add/remove locations during gameplay
2. **Custom Rotation Patterns**: Non-sequential scoring orders
3. **Location-Specific Timers**: Different intervals per location
4. **Advanced Markers**: Particle effects, custom models
5. **Statistics Tracking**: Per-location scoring statistics

### Code Optimization
1. **Macro Consolidation**: Reduce duplicate macro functions
2. **Dynamic Arrays**: Use NBT storage instead of scoreboard arrays
3. **Event-Driven Updates**: Only update markers when wool changes
4. **Batch Operations**: Group coordinate operations

## Conclusion

The multi-location scoring system adds significant strategic depth to Wool Wars while maintaining complete backward compatibility. The implementation uses efficient scoreboard-based data structures and macro functions for dynamic coordinate handling. The modular design allows for easy future enhancements and modifications.

The system is fully functional and ready for production use, with comprehensive error handling and user feedback systems in place.
